Configure special user role to access the flamingo contacts and messages wihtout admin permissions.

== Description ==
Imagine a situation where you (administrator) have an RSVP form through Contact Form 7 on your page and colleact the responses via Flamingo. You want somebody of your staff to oversee and handle the responses. Until now you would have to create a wordpress user and grant admin permissions to this user. This is because users without admin permissions cannot access the contacts and responses captured by Flamingo.
But now: ✨ TADA! ✨
This plugin creates a special role, which you can assign to your staff. Only admins can then decide, which specific Flamingo permissions this role should have. Your member of staff can then only access the Flamingo pages granted to this role.
